# Tableau Challenge
## Introduction
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program in New York City has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
A series of dashboards are needed to understand the data and provide the ability to the city officials to make decisions. The following work was made in Tableau to analysis the CityBike data from June-August, 2020.
